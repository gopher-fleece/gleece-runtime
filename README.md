Core runtime package for the [Gleece](https://github.com/gopher-fleece/gleece) tool.

## Overview

Gleece Runtime provides all the runtime dependencies required for Gleece controllers' implementation and for the routes generated by the Gleece tool.

## Installation

Get the runtime package:

```bash
go get github.com/gopher-fleece/runtime
```


## Usage

After installing, import the package in your project as needed. For example:

```go
import "github.com/gopher-fleece/runtime"

// @Tag(MyRoute)
// @Route(/my-base-route)
type MyController struct {
	runtime.GleeceController // Embedding the GleeceController
}

```

For route and specification generation, use the [Gleece](https://github.com/gopher-fleece/gleece) CLI.
